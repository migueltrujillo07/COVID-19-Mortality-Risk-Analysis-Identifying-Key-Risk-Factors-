# Conclusions

This exploratory data analysis examined demographic and clinical characteristics
associated with mortality in a large COVID-19 patient dataset.

## Main Findings

- **Age emerged as the strongest factor associated with mortality**, with death
  rates increasing sharply in older age groups.
- **Sex-based differences were observed**, as male patients consistently showed
  higher mortality rates than female patients.
- **Patient type was strongly related to outcomes**, with hospitalized patients
  experiencing significantly higher mortality than ambulatory cases.
- **Pre-existing chronic conditions**—including diabetes, hypertension, obesity,
  cardiovascular disease, and chronic renal disease—were associated with elevated
  mortality rates.

## Methodological Considerations

- The analysis is descriptive and exploratory; no causal claims are made.
- Outlier analysis was limited to age, as most clinical variables are binary.
- Although a COVID-19 case classification variable was available, no derived
  confirmed-case variable was created due to the absence of an official catalog
  of definitions. This avoids introducing assumptions or classification bias.

## Final Remarks

The observed patterns are consistent with findings reported in epidemiological
literature and highlight the importance of demographic factors and chronic
conditions in mortality outcomes.

This work provides a solid foundation for future statistical analysis or
predictive modeling and demonstrates a structured and reproducible exploratory
workflow for large-scale health data.
